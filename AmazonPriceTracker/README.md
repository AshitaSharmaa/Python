# Track the product price and when its price gets lower than the specified price, it will send me an email which
include the title of the product, the current price and a link to buy the product.

Here I used Web scraping using beautiful soap to get hold of the price.
Using Python programming, the comparioson has been made to check the price if it gets lower than $100.
Which in turn send me email specifying that now i can buy the product.
I used Python bot to automate this process. I launched this code on python Anwhere App and 
I have scdeuled it for 9am every morning which automaticaaly run the code and check for the price
