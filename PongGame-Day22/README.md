#**Classic Arcade Game**

Basically a ball that goes across the table and the two players which controls the paddle (move up and down ) on either side
to stop the ball going across the boundary.

If one miss the ball, the other player scores a point.

Here I have brokedown the problem as following:

> Create the screen
> create a paddle class where i created two paddles and provide functionality of moving up and down:
  > Right paddle uses arrow keys UP and DOWN to move the paddle up and down repectively
  > Left paddle uses keys W and S to move the paddle up and down repectively
> Create a ball class and make it move across the screen.
> Detect collision of ball with wall and bounce
> Detect Collision with paddle
> Detect when paddle misses
> Create a Score class to Keep score and display on the screen at the top.
